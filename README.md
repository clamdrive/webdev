# clamdrive/webdev

A simple PHP web development environment running on Docker.

You should maybe go through _@osteel's_ excellent tutorial:    
[From Vagrant to Docker: How to use Docker for local web development](http://blog.osteel.me/posts/2015/12/18/from-vagrant-to-docker-how-to-use-docker-for-local-web-development.html)

### Notes:

* I have installed adminer under `tools/adminer.php` rather than phpmyadmin.
